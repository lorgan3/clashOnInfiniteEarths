# Web & Mobile Development 14-15 Project 2

## Initial idea
1 to 4 players can play together in an area where they have to survive as long
as possible while beating enemies. Extras like pickups or dynamic terrain are
possible.

The game itself would use the following technologies:
* WebRTC for the multiplayer part. Peerjs would be a nice library for this.
* Three.js for the 3d part. This is a library that makes using WebGL easier.
* Google Closure Compiler (+gulp). This is a compiler that can optimise
JavaScript code. It also allows the the developer to split the code into
multiple files and forces the developer to write good documentation.
